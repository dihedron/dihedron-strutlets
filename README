VERSION 0.11.0 (released on 2013-06-01)

Implemented the BusinessContext and PresentationContext classes to shield 
unavailable functionalities away from developers at compile time. Developers can 
now choose to access portal functionalities through the classic ActionContext
(which provides all the available functionalities and may throw an exception
at runtime if something is invoked in the wrong phase) or a restricted view, e.g.
the BusinessContext, which filters methods that would throw at runtime if invoked 
in one of the "business" phases: ACTION and EVENT [thanks to A.Aidala and
R.Longobardi for pointing out this improvement].

Fixed a bug in the @Outputs interceptor that caused Strings to be stored as 
String[] in the Request scope [thanks to R.Sorbi for providing feedback on this
issue].

Improved handling of complex object types as render parameters in the @Output
interceptor.
