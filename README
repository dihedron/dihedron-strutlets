VERSION 0.11.2 (released on 2013-06-04)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FEATURE:
	Check if multiple instances of a Portlet can be instantiated by the portlet 
	container (by the standard) and, if so, provide a way to optimise initial
	registry loading by sharing configuration info across portlet instances, e.g. 
	by having registries as per portlet singletons.
PRIORITY:
	LOW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FEATURE:
	Set the Content-Type in non-JSP renderers: JSON renderer and XML renderer
	should set the response MIME type, whereas JSP renderer must not (this is 
	optional since JSR-286).

VERSION 0.11.0 (released on 2013-06-01)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FEATURE: 
	Implemented the BusinessContext and PresentationContext classes to shield
	unavailable functionalities away from developers at compile time. Developers
	can now choose to access portal functionalities through the classic
	ActionContext (which provides all the available functionalities and may throw
	an exception at runtime if something is invoked in the wrong phase) or a 
	restricted view, e.g. the BusinessContext, which filters methods that would 
	throw at runtime if invoked in one of the "business" phases: ACTION and EVENT 
	[thanks to A.Aidala and R.Longobardi for pointing out this improvement].
PRIORITY:
	MEDIUM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUGFIX: 
	Fixed a bug in the @Outputs interceptor that caused Strings to be stored as 
	String[] in the Request scope [thanks to R.Sorbi for providing feedback on 
	this issue].
PRIORITY:
	HIGH
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
BUGFIX: 
	Improved handling of complex object types as render parameters in the 
	@Output interceptor.
